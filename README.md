  - Description
    - VioletMarketplace is a full-stack Java(Spring Boot)/Angular project that allows users to create and trade NFTs. Going into this (Nov '21), I didn't know what NFTs were. Throughout the course of this project I learned a ton about NFTs and Web3 technology in general.

Challenges and Lessons We Learned
Jordy - This project was the culmination of our efforts during this BootCamp. There were various challenges throughout the sprint. My own personal challenge was populating a thread with replies to a Blog and persisting new replies. Combining JavaScript with HTML required me to do a great amount of research to make it all work. When working with others, you always have to learn to be open to diverse ideas and suggestions.

Diego - In this project, the foundations of REST really cemented, while also improving my familiarity with MySQL Workbench. One of the requirements for the project is to have encrypted login capabilities. I developed a better understanding on how to give users authorized access to the website. Once we started the Angular side of the project, I further understood the relationship between Models, Services, and Components.

Steph - Our final group project for me was a great experience to get more practice working in a group. Relying on a group is something I have struggled with in the past but my team members made that very easy and we all worked very well together. -->
